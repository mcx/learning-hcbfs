Code needed to replicate the examples from "[Learning Hybrid Control Barrier Functions from Data](https://github.com/unstable-zeros/learning-hcbfs/blob/main/Learning%20Hybrid%20Control%20Barrier%20Functions%20from%20Data.pdf)" by L. Lindemann, H. Hu, A. Robey, H. Zhang, D. V. Dimarogonas, S. Tu, and N. Matni, to appear at CoRL 2020.  See [here](https://github.com/unstable-zeros/learning-hcbfs/blob/main/CoRL_15min.mp4) for a short 15min video about our work!

Code for the bouncing ball case study can be found [here](https://github.com/unstable-zeros/learning-hcbfs/tree/main/bouncing_ball_for_share)

Code for the compass gait case study will be posted soon!
